<!-- TESTING -->

<!--
Your Pull Request will automatically be built and available under the following folder:
https://openhab.jfrog.io/openhab/libs-pullrequest-local/org/openhab/

It is a good practice to add a URL to your built JAR in this Pull Request description,
so it is easier for the community to test your Add-on.
If your Pull Request contains a new binding, it will likely take some time
before it is reviewed and processed by maintainers.
That said, consider submitting your Add-on in the Eclipse IoT Marketplace
See this thread for more info:

Don't forget to submit a thread about your Add-on in the openHAB community:
