# LswLogger Binding

This binding lets you connect to LSW logger for Sofar/Omnik/IE for SolarmanPV based on protocol v5 (iGEN tech).

## Supported Things

As for now two families of stick loggers are supported.

### LSW Logger

Supports following firmwares and serial numbers families.
- wifi stick with firmware - *LSW3_15_FFFF_1.0.57*, those have serial number starting with *17xxx*
- wifi stick with firmware - *LSW3_15_FFFF_1.0.65*, those have serial number starting with *17xxx*
- eth stick with firmware - *ME_08_2701_2.06*, those have serial number starting with *21xxx*

| Inverter | Stick firmware | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| Sofar Solar | LSW3_15_FFFF_1.0.57 <br/> LSW3_15_FFFF_1.0.65 <br/> ME_08_2701_2.06|  |

_Please note - some other sticks may be supported by this thing, though they were not tested._

### SN23xLoggerV5 (beta - testers and feedback needed)

| Inverter | Stick firmware | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| Sofar G3 | | |
| HYD 5-20KTL-3PH | | |
| ZCS Azzurro 3-Phase familiy:<br/> - 3PH HYD6000 ZSS | | Note that this won't work if your ZCS inverter is connected via Connext, you have to be using a Wi-Fi or Ethernet Kit such as ZSM-WIFI-USB |

_This thing is beta_

## Discovery

Binding does not support discovery.

## Thing Configuration

Each thing must be configured with following properties

| Property       | Value              | Description                                                  |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| hostname       | IP or hostname     | IP or network resolvable name of your logger stick           |
| port           | defaults to *8899* | Port for communicating with logger, mostly 8899              |
| serialNumber   | S/N, number        | Serial number of your stick logger                           |
